# ActiveInsights

One of the fundemental tools needed when taking your Rails app to production is
a way to track response times. Unfortunately, theres no free, easy,
open source way to track them for small or medium apps. Skylight, Honeybadger,
Sentry, AppSignal, etc. are great, but they are are closed source and
there should be an easy open source alternative where you control the data.

ActiveInsights hooks into the ActiveSupport [instrumention](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html#)
baked directly into Rails. ActiveInsights tracks RPM, RPM per controller, and
p50/p95/p99 response times and charts all those by the minute. It also tracks
jobs per minute, their duration, and latency.
